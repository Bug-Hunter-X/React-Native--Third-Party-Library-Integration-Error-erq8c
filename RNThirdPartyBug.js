This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not properly integrated with React Native's environment. This can happen when the library relies on features or modules that are not available or compatible with the React Native environment. For example, a library might assume the presence of a global object or a specific browser API that doesn't exist in React Native.  This often manifests as a runtime error indicating that a module or function cannot be found or that it is not defined.
