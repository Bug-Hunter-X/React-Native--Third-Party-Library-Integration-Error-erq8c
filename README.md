This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in React Native that arises from incompatibility between third-party libraries and the React Native environment. The bug is specifically focused on scenarios where a library expects features or APIs that are unavailable in React Native. The solution outlines how to address this issue by either finding an alternative library, patching the library to function correctly in React Native, or employing specific techniques to bridge the gap between library dependencies and the React Native runtime.
