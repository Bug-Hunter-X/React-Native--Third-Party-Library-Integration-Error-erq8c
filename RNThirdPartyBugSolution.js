The solution depends on the root cause. 
1. **Find an alternative:** Search for a different library that provides the same functionality and is designed to work with React Native. 
2. **Patch the library:** Examine the library's code and identify the conflicting module or API. If possible and feasible, modify the library's code to either use a React Native equivalent or to conditionally skip the incompatible dependency for React Native's context.   This typically involves checking for the existence of the module or API before trying to use it, offering a fallback mechanism if needed.   Be mindful of licensing implications when modifying a third-party library. 
3. **Bridging:**  Use platform-specific bridging techniques to create a communication layer between the React Native environment and the incompatible parts of the library. For instance, you might leverage React Native's Native Modules capability or similar methods to implement the missing functionality natively (iOS or Android) and expose them to the JavaScript part of your app. This is a more advanced solution and requires more development effort.
